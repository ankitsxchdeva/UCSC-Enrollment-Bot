This is a simple bot to enroll into classes at UCSC.
Please note that there are a couple of restrictions when using this application:
1. Duo authentication should already be filled out
2. You should already be logged into your MyUCSC account
3. Your shopping cart should already be filled with all the classes you want to take
4. All the classes you want to take should have spots available
5. Regular registration rules apply (prerequisites should be met, no holds on account)
6. The Selenium driver is setup to be used with GeckoDriver firefox, you can easily adjust it to be used with chrome
7. I wrote this program half asleep not wanting to register for classes during my ridiculous enrollment time, it is not garunteed to work in any way
8. 

Please reach out with any questions and concerns.
